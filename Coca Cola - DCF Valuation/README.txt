Coca-Cola DCF Valuation Model:

A fully dynamic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model built in Excel, including 5-year projections, WACC estimation via CAPM, terminal value calculation, and sensitivity analysis.

Model Features:

- 5-year operating forecast (2026–2030)
- Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) calculation
- WACC estimation using CAPM
- Terminal value using Gordon Growth Model
- Enterprise to Equity bridge
- 2D sensitivity analysis (WACC vs Terminal Growth)


Base Case Result:

- Enterprise Value: ~$236B  
- Equity Value: ~$206B  
- Implied Share Price: ~$29  

Under base-case assumptions, the model suggests intrinsic value below the current market price, implying the market may be pricing in stronger long-term growth or a lower cost of capital.
